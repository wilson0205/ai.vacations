JetBlue Vacations and Utrip partner to help travelers create a personalized, hour-by-hour vacation itinerary – including JetBlue flights, hotels and other amenities – online in just a few minutes. The trip planning portal, available through JetBlue Vacations, uses artificial intelligence and locally curated recommendations to save customers the legwork that planning a vacation requires.

The new feature is a step forward for JetBlue Vacations (formerly JetBlue Getaways) and its evolution to offer more personalized trip experiences. JetBlue Vacations is combining technology with JetBlue’s award-winning customer service to create a one-stop vacation shop and seamless travel journey.

Integrating Utrip into the JetBlue Vacations online experience makes it effortless for travelers to discover destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean based on what matters most to them. Through the partnership, travelers using the Utrip feature can book a JetBlue Vacations package and create an itinerary with a curated list of local recommendations.

“At Utrip, we are always striving to make travel an unforgettable experience,” said Gilad Berenstein, CEO and Founder of Utrip. “By collaborating with JetBlue Vacations, we’re excited to further our commitment to help our partners enhance their relationships with travelers, empowering them to discover new destinations and create lasting memories.”

Utrip’s vast database of more than 150 destinations has been curated by local area experts. To start planning, travelers go to jetblue.com/vacations and enter their destination and travel dates in the JetBlue Vacations-Utrip portal. Next they rank their travel preferences in sixteen categories, such as history, food, nightlife and budget. Utrip’s artificial intelligence algorithm, created by machine learning scientists, sorts through millions of potential combinations of sites, activities and restaurants – offering a suggested daily itinerary with recommended times and maps.
