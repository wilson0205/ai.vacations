Mezi (www.mezi.com), the leading chatbot shopping app empowered by human experts, announced today at MobileBeat the launch of the most advanced AI-powered travel bots for its mobile shopping app and SMS users. The Mezi experience goes beyond booking flights and hotels, and instead embodies the role of a full-service concierge that can plan, book, and track all of your reservations from a single messaging interface. Mezi utilizes the perfect blend of bot and human expertise to learn your shopping habits and create a seamless, personalized shopping experience unlike any other -- at no additional cost to the user.

The bots are equipped to handle all aspects of travel requests, including booking, rescheduling, and cancellation. In addition, the bots learn customer needs and preferences to deliver highly personalized recommendations, including proximity to specific landmarks and room necessities such as number and type of beds, or smoking versus non-smoking. Mezi can even account for rewards points, seat preferences, and hotel amenities such as free WiFi, parking, and family friendly features like pools and complimentary breakfast.

"In conjunction with our full-service shopping app, our new bots are helping us to create an intelligent pathway for conversational-commerce on mobile," said Mezi CEO and Co-founder Swapnil Shinde. "Mezi is providing the best of both worlds: mobile convenience and expert assistance. As our AI advances in other product categories, we look forward to serving even more customers while keeping their experiences consistently human."

The introduction of advanced travel bots enables Mezi to generate personalized recommendations for hotels and flights in less than two minutes, and handle 80 percent of common travel requests from end-to-end without the need for human intervention. Using natural language processing (NLP), Mezi's bots are able to understand a wide range of requests and even mimic speech patterns by learning from user conversations. The result is a rapid-fire conversational experience that makes them indistinguishable from human assistants.

"We believe that the best approach to artificial intelligence is one that considers humans and computers as complementary, rather than competing, resources," said Mezi CTO and Co-Founder Snehal Shinde. "Even self-driving cars have humans at the wheel just in case. With flight and hotel bots, we have created technology that not only expedites the research and purchase process, but integrates a human touch to deliver the highest quality of service possible for any chatbot currently on the market."
